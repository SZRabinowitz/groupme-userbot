# GroupMe Userbot Example

Hi, this is a simple userbot for GroupMe inspired by [gmuserbot](https://github.com/2CATteam/gmuserbot). It is written in Python and based off groupme-push library.
# Warning
I never actually learned Python properly, I only know it from examples and reading code. So don't use my code as an example of proper coding practices. And please, tell me what parts of my code are bad practice and I will try to fix it.
